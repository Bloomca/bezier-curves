##Bezier curves

This is simple bezier curve animation. You could add a nodes (just double click at empty space in grid) and delete them (again, double click at node). Animation now is quite slow (especially while dragging â€“ I'm working on it:) )

You can see it by [link](http://bloomca.github.io/bezier-curves/).

App is written in Backbone.js, CoffeeScript and Require.js.
